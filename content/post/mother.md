## Mother / Maa / Mummy

There are several names children will call for her but she is only one and unique for all kids.

I love my mother and no matter how often I say I love you my mother it will always be less.
You are the person I have met in my lifetime who has been so polite and uniform in nature in every situation, whether it was life challenging you from every aspects or it was the happiest moment of your life. You have always found the solutions to your problems without even making us realizing about it. Consiously or subconciously, I have learnt countless things from you. 

I have seen several mothers in my life and every mother is special but still when I look upon you and your way of dealing with life issues I feel you are unique and single God ever made. The feeling I feel for you can never be explained enough on words but you are so special in my life that I think I want you to be everywhere so I want to write  something about you.

I have seen families scatter after  sometime but you have always manged to keep all relations and bondings intact. I have often listened that we cannot make everyone happy but  I don't know how you manages here also.

Being a working woman and also a housewife it takes so much. You are a divine power we have in our life. All those things you have seen in your career and tackled I don't think an ordinary person could do. If I look back and start to connect the dots it seems like you always knew what to do in every situation before hand. You knew how to react to every persons reactions, how to make every person happy and also when to be strict and when not or may be just when to just show no response. Uff imagining all that I am tired but you have and still managing all of us.

I don't know how you managed to not think of your own maintenance ever but only of ours.
I feel so lucky to have you in my life. I cannot imagine my life without you. I pray you be with us forever and live 1000 more years. Just thinking of you makes me more stronger. You are the reason of all the good things that happens/will happen to our lives. Its your endless positive vibes that remains with us and help us in our way of living life.
