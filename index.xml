changes in package.json
empty out the script object Remove all things related to parcel such as for me its as mentioned below: * &amp;ldquo;@parcel/transformer-sass&amp;rdquo; * &amp;ldquo;parcel&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;^2.8.2&amp;rdquo;, Run npm i to remove all the packages.
Remove .parcel-cache
I had one project setup with vite in my machine so I copied the packages needed and vite scripts object to package.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://kajal.dev/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kajal.dev/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://kajal.dev/post/mother/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kajal.dev/post/mother/</guid><description>Mother / Maa / Mummy There are several names children will call for her but she is only one and unique for all kids.
I love my mother and no matter how often I say I love you my mother it will always be less. You are the person I have met in my lifetime who has been so polite and uniform in nature in every situation, whether it was life challenging you from every aspects or it was the happiest moment of your life.</description></item></channel></rss>
